I am a first-year Master's student at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, supervised by <a href='https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~arbel/'>Prof. Tal Arbel</a>.
I obtained B.Eng. degree in Computer Engineering from McGill University.

<b>Research interests:</b> My research focuses on advancing theories and algorithms for trustworthy machine learning, especially on out-of-distribution generalization, uncertainty quantification, and causality. Concurrently, I am working on leveraging AI to propel scientific discovery and innovate in medical diagnostics and treatment. I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute my ideas and knowledge to the AI community with a goal of realizing Human-AI society for the benefit of all.
